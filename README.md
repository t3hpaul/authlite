Authlite - a simple, lightweight authentication framework
=========================================================

Authlite is a simple authnentication framework built on Openshift and python by Paul Stasiuk, a student at Loyola University Chicago.

The framework is built to run on the OpenShift platoform running a python and mongodb cartridge with Flask, Twitter Boostrap, and Flask-Login.

Seeing as this was built in about 48 hours, the code is very dirty, lacks comments and has some minor bugs.

<b> This has not been fully tested and is not ready for production.</b>
